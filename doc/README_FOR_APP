######## Installation notes #################

Using rvm with ruby 1.9.2
Created a new gemset: cms 
Installed rails 3.1.3 with cucumber-rails and rspec-rails
Generated a new app:
    $ rails new cms -d postgresql -T --old-style-hash



################ HTML5 ######################

Decided to use rails-boilerplate to get HTML5 Boilerplate
integration. html5-boilerplate is more popular but pushes you to use
HAML which I have never really warmed up to. 

Per the instructions at https://github.com/khelben/rails-boilerplate
I added "gem 'rails-boilerplate'" to my Gemfile and reran bundle
install. Trying to run "rails g boilerplate:install" gave an error
complaining about not having a Javascript runtime:

  gems/execjs-1.2.13/lib/execjs/runtimes.rb:47:in `autodetect': 
  Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs 
  for a list of available runtimes. (ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable)

Decided to use rubyracer as I had for the Ticket tracker app. Also
added the other gems I was using for those exercises:

  group :assets do
    gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.1.5'
    gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.1.1'
    gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
    # JavaScript executable - Google's V8 as a ruby gem
    gem 'therubyracer'
  end

  gem 'jquery-rails'
  gem 'rails-boilerplate'

  group :test, :development do
    gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 2.5'
  end

  group :test do
    gem 'cucumber-rails'
    gem 'capybara'
    gem 'database_cleaner'
    gem 'shoulda-matchers'
    gem 'factory_girl_rails'
  end

$ rails g boilerplate:install
    conflict  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
Overwrite /home/cnk/rails/cms/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh] y

      create  public/apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png
      create  public/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png

Got replacement Apple Touch icons for Caltech from Dan - and a link to
information on using them:
http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html

Built 2 default stylesheets - one for structural elements and one for
styles that can be used within the WYSIWYG editor too. And edited the
application.css manifest to include both of them explicitly instead of
using require_tree. 

Removed 'require_tree .' from app/assets/javascripts/application.js so
I can include the WYWIWYG editor javascript only on admin pages.
